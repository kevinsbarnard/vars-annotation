## tl;dr

Sharktopoda is one of serveral video players that can interact with VARS. It is a macOS applications that provides robust playback support for h264 and ProRes video codecs.

## Installation

Download the latest release of [Sharktopda](https://github.com/mbari-media-management/Sharktopoda).

## Configuration

Sharktopoda and VARS communiate via a simple [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) protocol. The only configuration is that you will need to set the UDP port number to the same value in both Sharktopoda and VARS.

### Configuring Sharktopoda

Launch Sharktopoda and then go to _Sharktopoda_ > _Preferences_. In the preferences dialog, set the port number. At MBARI, we typically use `8800`. Make sure the `Run UDP Server` checkbox is checked.
